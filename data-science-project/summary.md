Current API Connection Status: ❌ NOT CONNECTED
What's Currently Running:
The app is using simulated/mock data instead of real API connections. Here's what I found:

1. Backend Status:
Currently running: main_simple.py (simplified version)
Data generation: Uses generate_sample_data() function that creates fake data with:
Random COVID-19 cases, deaths, recoveries
Random stock prices and volumes
Random weather temperatures, humidity, pressure
No real API calls are being made

2. API Keys Status:
Weather API: Uses 'demo' placeholder instead of real OpenWeatherMap API key
Stock API: Uses 'demo' placeholder instead of real Alpha Vantage API key
COVID API: The disease.sh API doesn't require authentication, but it's not being called

3. Real API Integration Code:
The actual API integration code exists in:
etl/data_collector.py - Has real API endpoints configured
etl/data_processor.py - Has real data processing logic
etl/main.py - Has full ETL pipeline
models/ml_models.py - Has real ML model training

4. What Needs to Be Done to Connect Real APIs:
Step 1: Set up API Keys
Step 2: Add Real API Keys
Step 3: Switch to Full Backend
Replace main_simple.py with main.py in the backend
The full backend has the real ETL endpoints that call actual APIs
Step 4: Run Real ETL Pipeline
The dashboard "Run ETL Pipeline" button would then call real APIs
Data would be collected from actual sources instead of generated

5. Available Free APIs:
COVID-19: disease.sh (no API key needed)
Weather: OpenWeatherMap (free tier available)
Stocks: Alpha Vantage (free tier available)

Summary:
Your app is currently a fully functional demo with realistic-looking data, but it's not connected to real APIs. The infrastructure is there - you just need to add API keys and switch from the simplified backend to the full version to get real data flowing through the system.





ETL STUFF

Dashboard Features Explanation

1. Run ETL Pipeline
The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline does the following:
What it does:
Extracts data from multiple sources:
COVID-19 data from disease.sh API (historical cases, deaths, recoveries)
Weather data from OpenWeatherMap API (temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed)
Stock market data from Alpha Vantage API (prices, volumes, indicators)
Transforms the raw data by:
Cleaning and validating the data
Adding calculated features (moving averages, growth rates, technical indicators)
Handling missing values and outliers
Converting data types and formats
Loads the processed data by:
Saving raw data as CSV files in the ../data/ directory
Saving processed data as CSV files with enhanced features
Generating insights and statistics about the data
Result: Fresh, cleaned data ready for analysis and model training, with detailed processing statistics.

2. Train Models
The model training functionality:
What it does:
Trains three different ML models:
COVID-19 Forecasting Model: Predicts future COVID cases using features like current cases, deaths, growth rates, and time-based features
Stock Prediction Model: Predicts stock prices using technical indicators, price history, and market features
Weather Classification Model: Classifies weather conditions using temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind data
Training Process:
Uses multiple algorithms (Random Forest, Linear Regression, XGBoost, SVM)
Performs cross-validation to find the best model
Calculates accuracy metrics (R², MSE, RMSE)
Saves the trained models to ../models/ directory
Result: Improved model accuracy and performance metrics, with models ready for making predictions.

3. Export Report
The export functionality:
What it does:
Generates a comprehensive data report including:
Data Source Summaries: Record counts, column information, last update times for each data source
Analytics Summary: Total data points, data freshness, trend analysis availability
Model Performance: Accuracy scores and status for each trained model
Recommendations: AI-generated suggestions for improving data collection and model performance
Report Content:
Data freshness assessment
Model accuracy comparisons
Recommendations for data expansion
Performance insights and suggestions
Result: A detailed JSON report that can be used for business intelligence, stakeholder presentations, or further analysis.

Current Implementation Status:
The dashboard is currently using a simplified version (main_simple.py) that simulates these processes rather than running the full ETL pipeline. The actual ETL pipeline code exists in the etl/ directory and would need to be integrated with the backend API to provide real functionality.
The simulation provides realistic feedback and timing to demonstrate the user experience, but the actual data processing and model training would require connecting to real APIs and running the full pipeline components.
